## GitHub workflow each time someone commits a change.

Learning Journey

Workflow Objective: To receive a Telegram notification on my phone when a push to repository occurs.
![telegram action](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93564452/146679202-754edef1-cf2f-467a-95a5-0993894d91f0.png)


Triggering action: On push


Issues encountered when trying to implement this action: Setting up of the Telegram Token and ID so that GitHub is able to interact with Telegram with the use of Telegram API. Issue was resolved after breifly studying the Telegram API
